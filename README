== Installation ==

To install into an existing Django project:

 * Add "apihangar" to your INSTALLED_APPS
 * include() "apihangar.urls" somewhere in your URLconf
 * Define APIHANGAR_DATABASES in your settings.py

APIHANGAR_DATABASES specifies which database connections may be used
by the apihangar to issue queries against.  The setting should be 
a list of 2-tuples (alias, label) where the aliases refer to database
connection aliases defined in your project's DATABASES setting.

IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED THAT YOU ADD "default" TO YOUR APIHANGAR_DATABASES.
The recommended way to use apihangar is to set up one or more read-only
database connections; add these as secondary databases in your DATABASES 
dict; and then use these read-only connections for your APIHANGAR_DATABASES.
